Pivoting is a post exploit technique that involves utilizing a compromised host to attack other systems on the compromised hosts private internet network.

After gaining access to one hosts, we can use the compromised host to exploit other hosts on the same internal network to which we could not access previously.

Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal networks subnet and consequently scan the and exploit the other systems on the network.

**once you gain access to a target machine you want to start enumerating everything, including the network info on that target**
ipconfig (meterpreter command once you establish foothold on machine)
**find the network**
run autoroute -s <10.2.27.0/20>
background session to find and run modules to run against the new network
auxiliary/portscan/tcp

we can perform nmap scan if we port forward the port to our local port
**back to session with the first target**
portfwd add -l <port> -p 80 -r <victim 2 ip> (forwards remote port 80 to our local port 1234)
db_nmap -sS -sV -p 1234 localhost or in a new tab you can run nmap -sV -p 1234 localhost
**now you can work on gaining access and enumerating the second target**
