After gaining initial access to a target system it is always important to learn more about the system like, what OS is running etc. This info is useful as it gives us an idea of what we can do and what type of exploits we can run.

We are looking for:
-Hostname
-OS Name (Windows 7,8 etc)
-OS Build and Service Pack (Windows 7 SP1 7600)
-OS Architecture (x64 / x86) (This is important so the things we transfer like MSFvenom payloads are compiled for the correct architecture)
-Installed updates/hotfixes
