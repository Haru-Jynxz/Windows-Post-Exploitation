MSF provides various post exploit modules for windows and linux

We can use these modules to enumerate info about the Window system we currently have access to:
Enumerate user privs
Enumerate logged on users
VM check
Enumerate installed programs
Enumerate AVs
Enumerate computers connected to the domain
Enumerate installed patches
Enumerate shares



sysinfo (Computer name, architecture, OS, Domain etc)
getuid
**if on meterpreter session you can type help to see what commands you can run**
getsystem, hashdump, enumdesktops, screenshot, show_mount, ps (process tree), dir, cd, cat, pwd, download, migrate, loot, shell (opens cmd prompt)

**if you put your session in the background you can run post exploit modules against this session instead of running enum commands manually**
