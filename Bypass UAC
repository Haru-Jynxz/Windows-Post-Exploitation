You can utilize the "Windows Excalate UAC Protection Bypass (In Memory Injection)" module to bypass UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher certificate 
through process injection. It will spawn a second shell with the UAC flag turned off.

If getsystem fails you can start to investigate why.
Spawn a cmd promt using the shell command through the meterpreter session
type net users to enumerate users
net localgroup administrators (to see who is apart of this group)

put the session in the background to run modules against

search bypassuac
in this example we will use bypass_injection module
set payload depending on target architecture
set session
ensure LPORT for the module is different than the session connection 

should now be able to getsystem (priv escalation) and hashdump etc with the newly elevated privs
