After gaining initial access to a system it is important to learn more about the system like, what user account you have access to and other user accounts on the system.

We are looking for:
-Current user and privileges
-Additional user info
-Other users on the system
-Groups
-Members of the built-in administrator group

getuid
getprivs
background session
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
set session and run
go back to your session
shell (opens window cmd prompt)
whoami (same as getuid)
whoami /priv (same as getprivs)
query user (shows currently logged on users)
net users (shows all accounts on system)
net user administrator (shows info about a specific user, in this case we chose administrator)

net localgroup (shows groups on system)
net localgroup administrators (shows who is part of this group)
