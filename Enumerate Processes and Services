We are looking for:
-Running processes & services (for migrating our session to x64 / x86)
-Scheduled tasks (priv escalation)

A process is an instance of a running exe or program
A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop

ps (shows running processes through process tree)
prgrep explorer.exe (shows the process id of a specific program, explorer.exe is usually a recommended one to migrate to)
migrate <process id>

shell (opens windows command prompt, we will go over how to do the above in windows shell)
net start (shows services, not processes)
wmic service list brief (shows services)
tasklist /SVC (shows running processes and the respective service being used by the process)
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v (can be used for priv escalation) looking for NT authority to run something you input or alter to provide an upgrade in privs through the use of a scheduled task. /v will provide additional info.

Scheduled tasks will run at specified times and the NT authority will provide the most amount of information for that t
